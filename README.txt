IMAPdedup is a python script (imapdedup.py) that looks for duplicate messages in an IMAP mailbox and marks all but the first one for deletion. Although efforts were taken to try to minimize false positive, user should always do a dry run first with the '-n' parameter before perform the deletion, which is generally irreversible.
