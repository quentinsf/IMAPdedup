IMAPdedup is a python script (imapdedup.py) that looks for duplicate messages in a set of IMAP mailboxes and marks all but the first message found for deletion. Although efforts were taken to try to minimize false positives, you may want to do a dry run first with the '-n' parameter.

Note that IMAPdedup will tell the IMAP server to *mark* messages as deleted. Exactly what that does in your environment will depend on your mail server and your mail client.  Sometimes deleted messages appear in a 'Trash' folder.  Sometimes they are hidden and can be displayed and un-deleted if wanted, until they are purged.
